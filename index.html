    <p>Wallabies are members of the kangaroo clan found primarily in Australia and on nearby islands. There are many wallaby species, 
    <br>grouped roughly by habitat: shrub wallabies, brush wallabies, and rock wallabies. Hare wallabies are named for their size and
    <br> their hare-like behavior.</p>
